**Visualization explanation**

**Use case**
When this infographic should be displayed

**SQL query**
Sql clause and usage guidance. In addition to query, detail which parameters should be modified when executing it
 and which output fields are language specific
When creating the query and filtering CBS data - it's better to use the numeric values of the categorical fields (accident_severity = 1 is better than accident_severity_hebrew = 'תאונה קטלנית'). For code redeablity - one can create constants and dictionaries.

**Information Tag**
Add short description that explains visualization content to the end user.

**Additional context**
- Definition will be used by BE team to generate a Json response to FE
- Definition will be provided by Data team, after internal review
- Definition will be written in English and should use language agnostic definitions and data structures 
(e.g. SQL columns) as much as possible.
