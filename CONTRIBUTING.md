Contributing to ANYWAY
======================

OMG. OMG. OMG. We are really glad you are joining the team!  We set up a contributor's guide that explains all about [setting up ANYWAY's development environment](http://hasadna.github.io/anyway) - prepare to be amazed. 

![Contributors guide](static/img/anyway.png)

This page contains information about reporting issues as well as some tips and
guidelines useful to experienced open source contributors. 

## Topics

* [Issues and Bugs] (#issues-and-bugs)
* [Feature Requests] (#feature-requests)
* [Coding Rules](#coding-rules)

## Issues and Bugs

As one of the teams working in the Knowledge Workshop, we put data credibility first. If you find any
discrepancies between the presented data and the information in the used open-source databases, please let us know.
Also, if you happen to stumble upon a bug, don't hesitate and raise a flag and we will get it fixed. You can send any your reports to [anyway@anyway.co.il](mailto:anyway@anyway.co.il). 
Don't forget to mention which operating system and browser you were using, so we can easily track down the issue.

If you are already digging through the code and our [unstable version](http://anyway-unstable.herokuapp.com/) and you happen to find a bug, please go ahead and [open a new issue](https://github.com/hasadna/anyway/issues).
 Just remember to look through the pre-existing ones to make sure there are no duplicates. Even better if you can take it on yourself, then we encourage you to report the issue, assign yourself and submit a Pull Request with a fix.

**Issue Report Format:**

```[Title]
``` 
```
**Issue** One-liner regarding the issue you discovered
```

```[Description] 
```
```
Explain why this is a bug, how to reproduce it and on which OS and browser you encounter it. If you can't fix it yourself, try to suggest a fix or any leads you found in the code.
Add any errors thrown from a non-minified stack trace, if possible. 
Attach any screenshots that are relevant.
```

Once you are done with the basics, don't forget to tag it with `bug` and `1 - Ready` and other relevant tags from the following list: `backend`, `frontend`, `easy`

## Feature Requests

New feature requests are more than welcome, just don't forget to pass them by the team and also check the issue list to avoid duplicates.
We generally submit **major changes** via direct email to our [mail center](mailto:anyway@anyway.co.il) and request **small changes** by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/hasadna/anyway/issues).

**Feature Request Format:**

```[Title]
``` 
```
**Feature** One-liner on the feature you'd like to implement
```

```[Description] 
```
```
Elaborate on the feature, why it is needed and the time frame in which you'd like it to be completed. If you have any suggestions or advice, share it with the team.
Also, mockups are very helpful - so you can try to make a simple screenshot to help us understand the concept.
```

Now tag it with `enhancement` and `1 - Ready` and other relevant tags from the following list: `backend`, `frontend`, `easy`, 


## Coding Rules

**Branch Names**

When working on your own bug fix or feature, make the changes on your forked repository:

* Bug Fix: assign yourself to the [open issue](https://github.com/hasadna/anyway/issues), tag it with `2 - Working`, create a new local branch and name it `XXXX-something` where XXXX is the number of the issue.

* Feature: create an [enhancement issue](#feature-requests) to announce your intentions or assign yourself to existing issue, and name it `XXXX-something` where XXXX is the number of the issue.



**Clean Code**

See the following python and js format guidelines and stick to them: 
* [Airbnb JavaScript Guidlines] (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
* [Python Style Guide] (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

Universally formatted code is crucial in open source projects and promotes ease of writing, reading and maintenance.



**Unit Tests**

All unit tests can be found in the "tests" folder. When adding a new test, make sure you follow this pattern: `test_*.py` (i.e: test_bounding_box_query.py).
To run the tests, use the following command:
`python -m unittest discover ./tests/`

Note that you can add a pattern so the discover command will find only your file as such:
`python -m unittest discover ./tests/ "*bounding*.py"`


Also, if you add an empty file, named `__init__.py` at tests folder, you'll be able to run more commands as:
`python -m unittest test_module.TestClass.test_method` (i.e: `python -m unittest tests.test_bounding_box_query`)



**Pull Requests**

Code review comments may be added to your pull requests, keep an eye out for necessary changes before merge approval. If the maintainer decides that your code is good, it will be merged to ANYWAY's Dev repository.
On your pull requests, don't forget to reference to the fixed bug / feature by adding `Closes #XXXX` or `Fixes #XXXX` to the body of the requests. Also, shortly summarize the changes made and list any
known-issues after the future merge (open new issues for them and reference to them as well).



**Squash Comment**

Before you make a pull request, squash your commits into logical units of work using `git rebase -i` and `git push -f`.
