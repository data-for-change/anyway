ANYWAY’s docker environment
===========================

Docker is an open source project to pack, ship and run any application as a lightweight container.

The idea is to deploy a container (light weight environment) that has all our app dependencies installed and ready to go.
As a developer you can do one of both:

* Use the container do write your code (using vim/nano or any other GNU text editing tool - not recommended)
* Use a git repo cloned to your local machine and use the container as a remote server running the app

The container loads itself with the command given in the instructions, it has the DB on it, deployed and ready to work (at /anyway/local.db)
With every local code change, the container would restart itself and the changes would be immediately available in your web browser.
The current image is based on an Ubuntu linux with java.

Instructions
-----------------------
* **For Windows users please first install ubuntu VM**. See [UBUNTU_VM_ON_WINDOWS](UBUNTU_VM_ON_WINDOWS.md)

* Please complete ANYWAY’s [“getting the code” section](https://github.com/hasadna/anyway#getting-the-code) before starting

**1.** [Get the code](https://github.com/hasadna/anyway#getting-the-code)

**2.** [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

**3.** Copy the GDRIVE_FILE_ID from [this file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IRnSsRwwHFtmGTNlSOfChg-H6R8JKMpl/view?usp=sharing) (You need to request access)
**Continue with your OS, See below**

**For Mac:**

**4.** If this is your first time installing ANYWAY Docker environment - move on to stage 5.
Otherwise, to build an existing environment with the most updated DB, remove DB volume by running `docker volume rm anyway_db_data`.
Note - this will delete all of your local DB data!

**5.** Build anyway container with updated DB data (in anyway main directory): `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build --build-arg RESTORE_DB=TRUE --build-arg GDRIVE_FILE_ID="<GDRIVE_FILE_ID value>"`
- To get <GDRIVE_FILE_ID value> - see part 3
- If you're having this kind of ERROR:Need service name for --build-arg option, make sure the docker-compose version is 1.25.2 and above (check with `docker-compose --version`)

**6.** Start the container, go to the **anyway** directory and run:
    `docker-compose up`
It will take a few minutes until it's done.

**7.** **You're all set!** ANYWAY is up and running with the DB data - connect to http://127.0.0.1:8080
Note - you won't see the map since the key works in production.
If you need to see the map contact atalya via slack to get a developer key.

**8.** To stop the containers run: `docker-compose down`

**For Ubuntu:**

If you need to see the map for development email us [anyway@anyway.co.il](mailto:anyway@anyway.co.il) to get a developer key.

**8.** To stop the containers run: `sudo docker-compose down`

## Additional Docker commands
Use `sudo` before each docker commands if you are using ubuntu.

To install requirements again, update DB schema OR redeploy any of the requirement involving the dependencies installation,
simply rebuild the image - Run in anyway directory:

    docker-compose build

Run docker-compose in detached mode - containers are running in background:

    docker-compose up -d

List your local docker images:

    docker images

List your running containers:

    docker ps

List all containers ever:

    docker ps -a

Stop a running container (id is listed in `docker ps`):

    docker top <container-id>

Rebuild the image:

    docker-compose build

Open container bash terminal to execute commands (while container is running):

    docker exec -it <container-name> bash

For example - to open the bash terminal of the db container:

    docker exec -it db bash

For example - to open the bash terminal of the anyway container:

    docker exec -it anyway bash

Inside the bash terminal of anyway container - run the following to use postgres command line:

    psql $DATABASE_URL

**Be careful with the following command** Deleting an image(from `docker images`):

    docker rmi <image-id OR image repository>

**Be careful with the following command** Remove the DB volume (this will delete all db data)

    docker volume rm anyway_db_data

**Be careful with the following command** Delete all docker unused images and all volumes

    docker system prune --all --volumes

Set your VM with the current running shell session:

    eval "$(docker-machine env default)"


Additional Notes
-----------------------
If you want to work with your own code and the docker OR if your 8080 port is already taken by other dockers\servers you need to create an override for the docker-compose.
For example:

```version: '3'
services:
 anyway:
   volumes:
     - ./anyway:/anyway/anyway
```

This loads the ./anyway dir (relative to the docker-compose file) as /anyway/anyway in the docker overriding the inner volume and allowing you to run your own code inside the docker.
