### Authorization

#### Description

User authorization is been done with OAuth 2.0 and Google as the OAuth 2.0 provider. When calling the authentication URL you will
be redirected to Google OAuth system (So the user need to be able to see the screen), after Google will authenticate the user he will be redirected
to https://www.anyway.co.il/authorize/google/callback/google and from there the flow will be redirected to the URL that was given in
the param `redirect_url` or to the default URL.

#### URL struct

#### Parameters

**redirect_url** - _string_ This parameter is optional. The param is a URL, if set it will redirect(HTTP 302 code) to
